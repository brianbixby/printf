You must manage the flags #0-+ and space
  
You must manage the minimum field-width
You must manage the precision
• You must manage the flags hh, h, l, ll, j, et z.

You must manage the flags #0-+ and space
  flags:
    -   : left justify;
      ex. printf("%-5d", 123);
    0   : field is padded wtih 0's instead of blanks;
      ex. printf(" %05d%s \n", 123, "hi");
    +   : prepends numbers with a plus or negative sign
      ex. printf(" %+5d%s \n", -123, "hi");
    #   : For o, x, X types, the text 0, 0x, 0X, respectively, is prepended to non-zero numbers
      ex. printf("%#x%s \n", 'c', "hi");
    ' ' : Prepends a space for positive signed-numeric types. positive =  , negative = -. This flag is ignored if the + flag exists. (The default doesn't prepend anything in front of positive numbers.)
      ex. printf(" % 5d%s \n", 123, "hi");

You must manage the minimum field-width
  specifies min # of charachters to output
    asterisk means the value is another argument
      ex. printf("%5d", 123);
      ex. printf("%*d", 5, 123);
  
precision
  specifies a maximum limit on the output
    asterisk means the value is another argument
      ex. printf("%.*s", 3, "abcdef")
      ex. printf("%.3s", "abcdef")

flags
  hh	For integer types, causes printf to expect an int-sized integer argument which was promoted from a char.
  h	For integer types, causes printf to expect an int-sized integer argument which was promoted from a short.
  l	For integer types, causes printf to expect a long-sized integer argument.
  For floating point types, this has no effect.[3]

  ll	For integer types, causes printf to expect a long long-sized integer argument.
  L	For floating point types, causes printf to expect a long double argument.
  z	For integer types, causes printf to expect a size_t-sized integer argument.
